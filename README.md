# Reusable Modal Component

# Challenge Description

In this challenge, let's create a re-usable `AppModal` component and use it to display the movie form.
Later on we'll improve this component to keep up with it's own display state .

## Requirements

- Move the current template for the modal into the `AppModal.vue` component and modify it for general re-use.
- The `AppModal.vue` component should meet the following specs:
  - Include a `slot` for the body content
  - Display a close (x) button
  - Display a title above the body content
  - Receive the following props:
    - `title`: a string for the title, defaults to `null`.
  - Emit the following events:
    - `close`: emitted when component is closed
- Use the `AppModal.vue` component to display the `MovieForm` in `App.vue`
- Import the `AppModal.vue` and `MovieForm.vue` component asynchronously so that the components' code is only downloaded once it's displayed
- The rest of the app should continue to work as before

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

## Example of finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
