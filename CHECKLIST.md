- The modal markup from `App.vue` is moved into the `AppModal` component.
- The `AppModal` component is used to display the `MovieForm` in `App.vue`
- The `AppModal` component has a default slot
- The `AppModal` component includes an `x` button to close it.
- The `AppModal` component dispatches a `close` event.
- The `AppModal` component accepts the `title` as prop, and it's defined as string.
- The `AppModal` component displays the `title` above the slot if provided.
- The `MovieForm.vue` is loaded asynchronously.
- The rest of our application still works as expected.
